For Questions 1,2,3 and 4, the codes are written separately, with the question put in the text box prior to the code for the question. The plots are present in the report. The
function names are pretty self-explanatory, as the purpose served by the function is given as the function name. Logging on to wandb is necessary to generate and see the plots.

Questions 5 and 6 are based on the plots generated in Question 4 and the intuitions drawn from them. The plots and the intuition derived from the plots are given in the report in 
detail.
