# Assignment 2 - Convolutional Neural Networks

### This folder contains the code for all the 3 parts of Assignment 2 of the course CS6910 - Fundamentals of DL.

### Group members: 
Karthik S - ME18B149
Aravint Annamalai - EE18B125

Part A:
  1) Train a CNN from scratch
  2) Sweep and perform hyperparameter tuning
  3) Visualize filters in 1st layer
  4) Perform Guided Backpropagation

Part B:
  1) Use a pre-existing CNN model
  2) Sweep and perform hyperparameter tuning

Part C:
  1) Make a video with object detection feature using YOLOv3(pre-trained model) - [Reference Model](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet)

## NOTE: Since there was a renaming mistake in one of the files(Part A), please check the commits of the entire folder to have a clear idea of commits and NOT check commits of just the new file. Thank you
